My daily routine is purposefully designed to strike a balance between achieving professional excellence and fostering personal well-being.

\textbf{\color{emphasis} Here's how I structure my day:}

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{\color{emphasis}Professional Focus (8 hours)}: I dedicate a full 8-hour block to my career, immersing myself in tasks such as coding, debugging, and project management. My goal is always to deliver impactful, high-quality results that align with both short and long-term objectives.

  \item \textbf{\color{emphasis}Continuous Learning (3 hours)}: I allocate 3 hours each day to continuous learning, making sure I stay at the forefront of technological advancements and keep refining my expertise.

  \item \textbf{\color{emphasis}Open-Source Contribution}: I actively contribute to open-source projects, collaborating with like-minded professionals to push the boundaries of innovation.

  \item \textbf{\color{emphasis}Personal Well-being}: Outside of work, I prioritize quality time with my family, as well as engaging in physical activities like boxing.

\end{itemize}

This balanced approach allows me to nurture both my career and personal growth while maintaining a high level of well-being and discipline.
